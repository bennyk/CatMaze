Implementing Astar pathfinding algorithm in cocos2d-x v3 and c++11.

This is my tutorial workout on cocos2d-x framework for implementing an
[Astar pathfinding algorithm] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) in c++11 (Astar is a popular routing algorithm
commonly used in games that trade-off some accuracy for speed). Art assets and game ideas used in this project are entirely derived
from this wonderful tutorial posted at [raywenderlich.com] (http://www.raywenderlich.com/4946/introduction-to-a-pathfinding).

I am learning as well hence any implementation comments are gratefully welcome.

### References

Further references about Astar beyond the tutorial you might find Amit's [page] (http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/) to be resourceful. Finally any good book about game AI should do the job. The current implementation made reference to the pseudo code outline in this [book] (http://ai4g.com/). You might want to check it out too.
