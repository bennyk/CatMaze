Implementing Astar pathfinding algorithm in cocos2d-x v3 and c++11.

This is my tutorial workout on cocos2d-x framework for implementing an
[Astar pathfinding algorithm] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) in c++11 (Astar is a popular routing algorithm
commonly used in games that trade-off some accuracy for speed). Art assets and game ideas used in this project are entirely derived
from this wonderful tutorial posted at [raywenderlich.com] (http://www.raywenderlich.com/4946/introduction-to-a-pathfinding).
